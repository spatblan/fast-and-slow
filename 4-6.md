<li>Samantha  will not leave the seats and disrupt the class</li>

</ol>




### Target Replacement Behaviors: 
<ol style="border:1px solid #333;padding:14px 0 14px 40px;background-color:#f3f6fa;">
<li>Samantha will improve her reading.</li>
<li>Samantha will stay at her seat unless she has teacher’s permission.</li>
<li>Samantha will attend P.E. class and change her gym clothes.</li>
<li>Samantha will respect her peers and follow school rules.</li>
<li>Samantha will make friends.</li>
</ol>




### Student Feedback: 
<ol style="border:1px solid #333;padding:14px 0 14px 40px;background-color:#f3f6fa;">
<li>If Samantha insists on reading 30 minutes a day, she won’t be struggling academically so much. The teacher can work on her reading. For example, choose proper reading material so she can handle it. Gradually build her interest and confidence. If she can finish reading everyday and have a small note or reflection, she will be rewarded.</li>
<li>Let Samantha deeply know what class rules we have and why we need to follow. If she can follow the rules and won’t leave the seats without the teacher's permission, she is helping the class, and her behaviour is appreciated.She will be rewarded with behaviour credits.</li>
<li>The P.E. teacher or the counselor can work together to talk with Samantha and know why she missed the class. Remind her that wearing gym clothes is also a class rule that needs to be followed.The P.E. teacher can arrange some sports or activities for her or group her with some outgoing peers. Give her more attention in this class. By doing this, Samantha will gradually start to enjoy P.E.</li>
<li>Let Samantha knows clearly that her behaviour is inappropriate. Going to the principal's office means this incident is very serious,there is a consequence of  what she did to other classmates. There also a record will be included in her student profile.Reinforce the class rules and let her know how and why she needs to respect others.</li>
<li>Samantha is alone in school, maybe she does not good at socializing, if the teacher can help her and introduce one or two friendly peers to her, let Samantha start to learn get along well with one or two people, having a regular check form her or her friends, she would get better on social.</li>
</ol>




### Methods to Monitor:
<ol style="border:1px solid #333;padding:14px 0 14px 40px;background-color:#f3f6fa;">
<li>Observe and interact with Samantha on a regular basis.</li>
<li>Having feedback from her peers.</li>
<li>Samathan’s  behavior and improvements will be summarized every week, and the subject teacher’s keep in touch with her behavior.</li>
<li>Make adjustments if it seems some methods do not work for her.</li>



### Family Communication: 
<ol style="border:1px solid #333;padding:14px 0 14px 40px;background-color:#f3f6fa;">
<li>A conversation with both guardians is necessary, win their support to help Samantha together.</li>
<li>Ask her guardians to join class 123, they can see Samantha behavior. Phoning them at the end of each week. </li>
<li>Having the parents also jolt down Samathan’s behavior at home and ask how she feels in school. Getting to know better about her deep thoughts helps to help her make changes.</li>




### Follow Through: 
<ol style="border:1px solid #333;padding:14px 0 14px 40px;background-color:#f3f6fa;">
<li>Every month have a meeting with her guardians if possible.</li>
<li>Asking her subject teacher to see if she has any changes(including the positive and the negative aspects)</li>
<li>Having a purposeful talk with her. People talk for the sake of being heard. The teacher monitors for the sake of finding out if the knowledge has transferred or the behavior has changed. The teacher can adjust instruction to meet her needs of their findings. </li>
