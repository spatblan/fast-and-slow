<pre>
<b>Date:</b>  9/14/2021      	             <b>Duration of Intervention:</b>  Approx. 3 months

<b>Student:</b> Samantha                   <b>Class/Grade:</b> 6th Grade
</pre>

### Goals:
<ol style="border:1px solid #333;padding:14px 0 14px 40px;background-color:#f3f6fa;">
<li>Samantha  will not struggling academically</li>
<li>Samantha  will not leave the seats and disrupt the class</li>
<li>Samantha  will not miss P.E. class</li>
<li>Samantha  will not physically assault others</li>
</ol>




### Target Replacement Behaviors: 
<ol style="border:1px solid #333;padding:14px 0 14px 40px;background-color:#f3f6fa;">
<li>Samantha will improve her reading.</li>
<li>Samantha will stay at her seat unless she has teacher’s permission.</li>
<li>Samantha will attend P.E. class and change her gym clothes.</li>
<li>Samantha will respect her peers and follow school rules.</li>
<li>Samantha will make friends.</li>
</ol>




### Student Feedback: 
<ol style="border:1px solid #333;padding:14px 0 14px 40px;background-color:#f3f6fa;">
<li>If Samantha insists on reading 30 minutes a day, she won’t be struggling academically so much. The teacher can work on her reading. For example, choose proper reading material so she can handle it. Gradually build her interest and confidence. If she can finish reading everyday and have a small note or reflection, she will be rewarded.</li>
<li>Let Samantha deeply know what class rules we have and why we need to follow. If she can follow the rules and won’t leave the seats without the teacher's permission, she is helping the class, and her behaviour is appreciated.She will be rewarded with behaviour credits.</li>
<li>The P.E. teacher or the counselor can work together to talk with Samantha and know why she missed the class. Remind her that wearing gym clothes is also a class rule that needs to be followed.The P.E. teacher can arrange some sports or activities for her or group her with some outgoing peers. Give her more attention in this class. By doing this, Samantha will gradually start to enjoy P.E.</li>
<li>Let Samantha knows clearly that her behaviour is inappropriate. Going to the principal's office means this incident is very serious,there is a consequence of  what she did to other classmates. There also a record will be included in her student profile.Reinforce the class rules and let her know how and why she needs to respect others.</li>
<li>Samantha is alone in school, maybe she does not good at socializing, if the teacher can help her and introduce one or two friendly peers to her, let Samantha start to learn get along well with one or two people, having a regular check form her or her friends, she would get better on social.</li>
</ol>




### Methods to Monitor:
<ol style="border:1px solid #333;padding:14px 0 14px 40px;background-color:#f3f6fa;">
<li>Observe and interact with Samantha on a regular basis.</li>
<li>Having feedback from her peers.</li>
<li>Samathan’s  behavior and improvements will be summarized every week, and the subject teacher’s keep in touch with her behavior.</li>
<li>Make adjustments if it seems some methods do not work for her.</li>
</ol>

### Family Communication: 
<ol style="border:1px solid #333;padding:14px 0 14px 40px;background-color:#f3f6fa;">
<li>A conversation with both guardians is necessary, win their support to help Samantha together.</li>
<li>Ask her guardians to join class 123, they can see Samantha behavior. Phoning them at the end of each week. </li>
<li>Having the parents also jolt down Samathan’s behavior at home and ask how she feels in school. Getting to know better about her deep thoughts helps to help her make changes.</li>
</ol>



### Follow Through: 
<ol style="border:1px solid #333;padding:14px 0 14px 40px;background-color:#f3f6fa;">
<li>Every month have a meeting with her guardians if possible.</li>
<li>Asking her subject teacher to see if she has any changes(including the positive and the negative aspects)</li>
<li>Having a purposeful talk with her. People talk for the sake of being heard. The teacher monitors for the sake of finding out if the knowledge has transferred or the behavior has changed. The teacher can adjust instruction to meet her needs of their findings. </li>
</ol>

## Putting it all together
The first time that I fell  in love with studying and doing activity work was on Module 4. Because I can finish my work earlier than before and I am expecting to have our lesson each time.

 

 

I will combine it with my current experience as a student because I am currently not teaching.

 

 

I started to share my thoughts in our class twice in group cohort class. Unfortunately it did not happen on the first 3 modules. I will start to share something only if I am asked.This tells me that the classroom environment is very important, it affects all the students no matter what age and level they are. Creating a comfortable classroom environment is an external factor, but it is important and it is the first thing students can feel. Undoubtedly, this sometimes can affect students' effective learning and their interest.

 

 

For setting high expectations, I have shared how I thought in the class. Setting a high bar, the students will pursue it; setting a low bar, the students will lose the chance to see what is a good expectation and how far they can go. We need to believe each student has their talent, it is not that they cannot reach the goal, it is just that they haven’t reached it “yet”.

 

About Using Technology Tools, I personally like to experience new things and tools. I think nowadays with technology, student learning is getting more effective and fun. My takeaway is I can collect or ask students about every new technology tools feedback that we use. It is not for criticizing the tools, but it is for knowing how students want to learn and how they want to do this work, and how I will design my class next time in a way that they like. Also helps me to learn to see things from another perspective.

 

In the end, I want to say that by watching the “know your why” video, my first thought came to my mind is this can help my life situation（because I do not teach currently). A lot of times we are doing things and we know what we are doing, but we are still facing a dilemma when we need to make choices. But knowing your why can really help us make the choice, because it forces you to deeply think about what you want in the bottom of your heart. As this reflects on students. It is the same, if we are facing classroom management or other problems, if we know why our students act or do it in this way, we could work together and find a solution to help them. In this process, we might need to put a lot of effort, but as an educator we want to make a difference for students. Just like "When you know why, your what has more impact, because you are walk in or towards your purpose".

 

I really appreciate we can have you as our instructor on Module 4, I feel I  had useful takeaways on our lesson. Not only for class but also in life. Thank you so much.
