## Introduction to Classroom Climate
### Overview
Managing the learning environment starts with building a classroom climate and culture conducive to student learning and achievement. Classroom or school climate is a combination of numerous elements including teaching practices; respect for diversity; and relationships among administrators, teachers, families, and students. Classroom or school culture refers to the way teachers and staff work together and the beliefs, values, and assumptions they share.
### Outcomes
Summary 1： I think on the second video, the teacher created an excellent classroom climate. From the beginning, he knows how to address student needs.When teachers intentionally address these needs in the classroom, students are happier to be there. This can increases student engagement and learning. Second, he has high expectations for his student's work and their behavior. When he introduced the Youtuber activity , I thought it might be a little difficult for Grade 3. But the teacher well scaffolded for each step. He expects that his students will do well and encourage them by letting them know that he believe in them. Last, he provided appropriate learning support for all students all the time, he gave them plenty of opportunities to practice and he always acknowledge the students efforts. This habit can improve students performance on the next assessment. I really like what the teacher did for this class.

## Building a Positive Climate and Culture
### Overview
Building a positive climate and culture doesn’t happen by accident. It requires careful planning and developing norms and expectations for how students will behave. With the onset of online learning, it is important to be cognizant of what norms and expectations would work or not work in physical and online learning environments. In this activity, I will be researching and discussing with my cohort ways to build a positive classroom climate and culture that I can implement in your own classroom.
