## Students in the Digital Age

By interviewing educators you will broaden and deepen your understanding of how the right type of technology can enrich the studentsâ€™ educational experiences. You will also learn how differentiation can be personalized by incorporating specific technological tools. 

In this activity, I will 
- Design questions for teacher interview on use of technology for learning
- Design 'getting to know you' Student Questionnaire with sample responses
- Summarize my findings in a Vlog

## Student Centered Learning

We talk a lot about student-centered learning, but what exactly does it look like? How do we know when our teaching practices are indeed student-centered? By investigating and discovering both specific student-centered activities and general qualities of a student-centered approach, you will deepen, define, and internalize your own understanding of and insights into student-centered learning. Student-centered learning is primarily an approach to teaching. Although there are many well defined and time tested student-centered activities, your goal should be to design your own activities, and tweak those of others, to meet the specific needs of your students. In this activity, I will collaboratively research and identify student centered solutions with my cohort in a project-based context.
