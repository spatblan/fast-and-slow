##  Inspirations and Dispositions for Teaching
### Overview
Inspirational speakers often stimulate our thinking about how we can approach our work differently. In this activitym I will integrate creativity and promote student- centered learning in the classrooms.

##  Laws and Policies that Affect Teaching
### Overview
Laws impact teaching and learning in a nation's schools. Governments may require all children of a specific age to attend school. They may determine the subjects to be taught. Governments in some countries have outlawed the segregation of schools, opened classrooms to students with disabilities, required bilingual education or English as a second language for English language learners, and/or mandated students to take standardized tests annually. These laws and policies can have a great impact on the everyday lives of students and teachers. In this activity, I will create a video on one of the laws or policies that affect education in my country.

## My Teaching and Learning Journey
### Overview
Being a reflective educator means documenting and communicating your own learning journey. Creating an e-portfolio is a good way to showcase your learning in the Teach-Now program and is a useful tool to share with others (including future employers). By including artifacts such as classroom management plans, assessments or example unit plans, you demonstrate you are an effective and knowledgeable educator.
