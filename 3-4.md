## Game Design for Learning
### Overview
For this project I will continue the game design exercise I started last week and design the details of my game. Focus on two things only: game engagement value and learning value, i.e. how interesting will the game be for your students and how deeply will they learn the topic.

## Designing a STEAM Project
### Overview
It is time to apply it to students for a specific grade level and subject area. Think about how your students can be part of the big project but also complete specific activities related to a topic area in the subject. Try to look for topics that have cross-curricular themes and easily lend themselves across different subject areas. Most importantly select goals and design objectives that adequately and appropriately challenge all your students. Finally, find tasks and activities that students complete that will hold interest and engagement value for students at the same time provide them with the adequate autonomy to achieve those tasks. You want to build a culture where students feel responsible for their own learning.
