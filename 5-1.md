## Different Types of Assessments

   Feedback in a formative assessment occurs while there is still time to take action. It functions as a global positioning system, offering descriptive information about the work, product, or performance relative to the intended learning goals. It avoids marks or comments that judge the level of achievement or imply that the learning journey is over.

### Overview

Assessment is key to effective teaching and learning. In order to understand what our students know and are able to do, we must continuously assess student progress. This helps us to inform our instruction and determine next steps for learning. Assessment can take many different forms and be used in a variety of ways. It is important to understand different types of assessments we can use in the classroom. We must also be able to determine whether we are using assessment as learning, of learning, or for learning. In this activity, you will explore the different types of assessments and consider when each can be used in the learning process.
