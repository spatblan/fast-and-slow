## Norms and Expectations
### Overview
Norms and expectations in this activity are positively framed statements that focus on creating a safe learning environment. Norms are the basis of creating and managing a positive learning environment. In order to create a safe, engaging, and student-centered learning environment classroom norms and expectations should be clearly communicated and agreed-upon by all stakeholders in the classroom.

## Modifying Classroom Management Strategies
### Overview
One strategy to more effectively manage the learning environment is to observe other teachers in action. By watching other educators employ strategies and techniques, you can determine what works for your classroom and your students. In this activity, I will have the opportunity to reflect on the classroom management of an educator and prepare to have a conversation in your next virtual classroom on my analysis.
### Outcomes
Video Annotations with recommendations to improve classroom management Summary: I am glad to watch videos 3 and 4 for middle school. Both videos are good lesson and with a positive class environment. The following are my summary for each video and comparison. In video 3, I feel this lesson is more relax and the teacher having a great interaction with the students. For each activity, students are engaging and interested to do it. The teacher greeting with students at the beginning to create a relax class environment. The he had agenda listed to let the students know what they need to do today. Thus, the students will have expectations for the following activities. His activity is fun and attractive, he gave students positive feedback, but he did not stop any actions of students in this lesson. During his class, we can see there are moments students moving around, talking while teacher is speaking, eating food etc. I believe this is not a good learning environment in the long run. My recommendation is: the teacher should set specific rules or norms for the class, then the students know what the teacher’s expectations is, so they can apply it in the class. In video 4, I think the teacher is very experienced through her teaching process. While she is teaching, she uses multi-intelligence approach to make sure students understand. She cares if the students really know the vocabulary, she used different practice and activities to assess their learning. In this whole lesson, I can tell this class basically have no students interrupt the class, they all follow the rules and teacher’s instruction, which means the teacher has a great classroom management skill. I think this class students can well follow the procedure from the bell work, this led to them know what they need to do while doing activities, answering questions with raise hands, and this shows different norms like collaboration, respect. Compare two videos, I feel the first one class environment is relax and comfortable. His activity is great, this teacher knows how to build a good relationship with students. But I did not see how their Kahoot quiz process and what is the Kahoot quiz about. How the quiz related his content and if that is effective. I would have adjusted activity to let the students do “all about me” as well. The second video showed very detailed for each teaching section and practice, I believe this is good for students to learn the content or maybe test. In addition, I can see the students also engaging for each activity, but I don’t feel the whole class as relax and comfortable as the first one. Maybe she can adjust different activities or reduce some time of it and move to next step.

## Routines and Procedures
### Overview
In order to have a classroom conducive to learning, students need to follow the teacher’s expectations. You must have routines developed so that students know what to expect and what to do in the classroom. Also, you should be prepared to manage situations where students are unable or unwilling to follow the set routine.
