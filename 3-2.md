## Challenges of Tomorrow

> ### OVERVIEW

> As an educator in the 21st Century, it is important for you to answer the question, “What year are you preparing your students for?” Traditional schooling and assessments that are prevalent from the industrial age are no longer valuable learning experiences for students. It is your responsibility as an educator to prepare your students for a newer, digitally advanced, world where many of today’s jobs won’t exist by the time the students enter the world of work. In this activity, I will be using the time in your weekly virtual class to begin the discussion on the challenges of tomorrow that my students will face and brainstorm ideas with my cohort on how we will prepare them for these challenges.

## Differentiated Instruction Strategies

> ### OVERVIEW

> In this activity, I will collaborated with your cohort to gather information on student-centered learning. I have also gathered a variety of information on your existing or future students. But being acquainted with a variety of student-centered activities, approaches, and practices is grand, but it's not enough. We need to choose and apply this information based on what you know about your students. In this activity, I will review a case study and enhance it with additional student-centered activities and technology that I have learned about.

## Technology Enhanced Instruction

### OVERVIEW

In this activity, I will focus on creating a 21st Century learning experience for my students. I will evaluate an existing lesson plan to see how it can be converted into a technology infused lesson where students actively use technology to enhance and deepen their learning.I now have the opportunity to explore newer technology based learning strategies such as mobile learning, augmented or virtual reality, or any other technology that I have not tried before. I will also think about how the lesson can be delivered or implemented virtually or in a blended learning environment.
