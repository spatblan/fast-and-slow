## Differentiated Instruction Strategies

### Overview

In the previous week, I will collaborated with your cohort to gather information on student-centered learning. You have also gathered a variety of information on your existing or future students. Now you will synthesize all this information and reflect on those student-centered activities, approaches, and practices that are most relevant and applicable to your students. Being acquainted with a variety of student-centered activities, approaches, and practices is grand, but it's not enough. You need to choose and apply this information based on what you know about your students. In this activity, you review a case study and enhance it with additional student-centered activities and technology that you have learned about.
