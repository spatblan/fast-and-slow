## Plan for Improvement in the Learning Environment

## Transitions

### Overview

The time students spend in the classroom is limited and, therefore, extremely valuable. Teachers must strive to make the best use of instructional and learning time by developing, planning, teaching, and practicing procedures for all activities in the classroom. This includes the entry routine, transitions within the classroom, and the exit routine.  Transitions must be practiced until students can do them automatically. This is true in both the physical and online learning environments.

## Giving and Receiving Feedback

### Overview

Now that you have reviewed how to create a positive classroom climate and culture, norms and expectations, and routines and procedures, it is time to observe lessons. In this activity, I will be reviewing video lessons of teachers in your specific grade band for both the physical and online learning environments.
