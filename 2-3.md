## Students with Learning Difficulties

### Overview

Classroom teachers have an integral role in creating an inclusive classroom for students with disabilities. They need to identify and monitor struggling students and intervene with teaching strategies for improving students' academic and behavioral performance. Teachers are critical in the process of identifying students who may need special services. Therefore, it is important to understand the special education referral process and signs to look for in a struggling student. In this activity, I will have the opportunity to interview regular and special education teachers about the referral process in their schools.

##  Assistive Technologies for Intervention

###Overview

 As a teacher, you may be required to implement the Individualized Education Program (IEP) for the students with disabilities in your classroom. Appropriate accommodations or interventions and assistive technology will help you create learning opportunities for struggling students and build their IEP. In this activity, I will work with my cohort to identify accommodations and assistive technology for the 13 disability categories in IDEA (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act).

## The Future of Schooling

### Overview

Change can occur in incremental ways or through major events in history that permanently shift the status quo. Given how the pandemic has impacted human life in every way, the social and physical constructs of schooling have similarly been disrupted. While this shift has led to disorganization, it also creates an opportunity to re-imagine schooling based on what is most important for student learning, growth, and development. The impetus for change and redesign has never been greater. In this activity, I will explore opportunities and possibilities for education and redesign what learning and schooling should look like in the 21st Century and beyond.
