## Game based Learning
### Overview
There is a growing body of evidence pointing to the value of games and play in education and learning. Games are inherently user-centered, and hence educational games, if designed properly, are inherently student-centered. They are motivating and provide a means of teaching concepts and skills that might otherwise be viewed by learners as irrelevant or uninteresting. Games can also result in deeper, more meaningful learning. There has been significant research into how play, games, and the concept of cognitive flow enhance learning, and there is general recognition that the range of experiences and conditions that prohibit cognitive flow are usually detrimental to learning. Cognitive flow is a psychological state of focused concentration on and engagement in an enjoyable activity to such an extent that the subject experiences a number of effects such as selective sensory perception (i.e., tuning out external sounds), and unnoticed passage of time (i.e., hours seem like minutes.) 
In this activity I will apply game based learning principles to create an educational game design plan for students.

## Project based Learning
### Overview
It is no coincidence that many effective teaching strategies and techniques require 21st Century skills. Project-based learning (PBL) is a holistic instructional strategy that brings students as close to real world applications as possible in an educational context. It requires learners to use 21st Century skills at discrete points and for specific processes and procedures of the activity. Projects give students the freedom to explore various connections between concepts outside of the prescribed mode of instruction and allows them to be cross-curricular learning moments. Projects also allow students to personalize work and be creative in their interpretations and delivery mechanisms. Well-designed projects can lead to deeper learning experiences for students. In our teaching, we need to identify and define how 21st Century skills are actually realized and used in our activities and how we can design and implement strategies so that learners maximize their meaningful use of these target skills. One way to do this is to design a cross-curricular STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math) project.
