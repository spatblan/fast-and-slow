### Plan for Managing the Learning Environment
Name: Chongchong Chao
Student Grade level or Grade range (e.g. PK-5): ______Grade 7________
Subject Area: ____Chinese__

1.Classroom Culture and Climate: Write a reflection on what you think constitutes a positive classroom climate. List 3-5 strategies that you would like to try in your own classroom. The strategies should rely on professional learning communities and address the physical, social, and emotional needs of the whole child. 

Classroom Culture and Climate
Reflection:

    “well-being is a positive sense of self, spirit and belonging that we feel when our cognitive, emotional, social and physical needs are being met” . As I became a student to learn a new language, I started to realize the importance of classroom climate. And I believe Well-being is fundamental to overall student success. It means If a person does not feel safe, appreciated, or successful, they likely will not be motivated to work hard. Students must feel that they are part of a classroom family and a larger school family. They need to feel responsible for the successes and failures in the classroom. Thus, I would use these strategies in my classroom.


Strategies for Positive Classroom Climate
 
1.Build rapport with my students :Greeting each  student by name as they enter the classroom. Also making time to interact with each student individually,try to listen to their comments, concerns, and worries while modelling empathy, showing the teacher's  interest in their stories and experiences.
2.Arrange the Physical Environment: Assigning seats to students at the beginning of the year. Also, arranging furniture to ensure all students are able to see the teacher and the board,  establishing routines for distributing and collecting material in an orderly manner.

3. Set High Expectations: Establish clear and consistent behavioural expectations with your students. Involving students in setting behavioural expectations can improve compliance. Be sure to address bullying and peer victimization in your discussions. Consider revising expectations halfway through the year; expectations should change over time, as students become better able to manage their own behaviours.
4.Provide Feedback and Reinforcement: Acknowledge and praise positive behaviours. Depending on the student and the situation, this can be done in front of the whole class, individually, or through communication with parents/caregivers.It is important to recognize and reinforce students’ efforts and not only results. Also, Provide effective coaching and supervision. For example, periodically review the rules and expectations, supervise students by regularly scanning the classroom, move around the classroom and occupy the whole space, and quickly deal with problems in a calm and positive way. 	


Strategies or Modifications for Virtual Learning Environment
           
           1.Sustain participants’ interest
During the lesson encourage group interaction. As a rule, interaction has to take place every 3-5 minutes. This rule, of course, can be modified according to your working style and the specific topic. Ask specific questions and give guidelines to students as to the way the teacher expects them to reply.
 
2.Provide materials
Plan the lesson so as to fit into the pre-set time frame without overloading students with new information at the expense of practice and interaction with them.Prepare the study materials, assignments and topics for discussion by providing a balance between new knowledge introduction and time for understanding, thinking about it and putting it into practice. Just in case the teacher  finishes earlier with the activities planned, prepare additional study materials in the File Library so that they can easily use them in case of need.

3.Make learning process more interesting and engaging 
Make learning more interesting and engaging by means of multimedia elements.The inclusion of various media (images, video, audio, etc.) in the 


study content presentation through the media player and the screen-sharing tool must be balanced and meaningful so as not to divert the learner's attention from the focus on the study content. It is vital for the study materials to be based on the educational aims and not to be used for their own sake. With more difficult topics the teacher can use the multimedia for simulations and for representation of complex concepts and phenomena.



2.Classroom Norms and Behavior Expectations: Classroom norms are the foundation of a safe, engaging, and student-centered learning environment. List 3-5 clear, concise, and positively framed norms and expectations that will guide the learning environment.
Universal and Simple: Focus on some themes or big ideas that might include respect and integrity. Do not include every possible rule or policy you might need; rather generate a few overarching norms that encompass many rules. 
Positive: Norms are positive statements about what students and teachers do in order to learn and collaborate effectively. Avoid negative norms (i.e. “Do not…” “No…”).
Collaborative: Involve your students in developing and discussing norms and expectations. This allows them to contribute and gives ownership of the class.

Classroom Norms and Behavior Expectations
 Be respectful:
              Respect is a very important foundational factor in the development and maintenance
              of a healthy learning environment. It is respect that opens space for the development
              of trust and learning. In schools,  all students need to  respect themselves, their peers, 
               and their property. As we who work within them know too well, things happen that  
               require others to trust us and follow our lead.

 Treat others the way you would like to be treated：
7th graders students have problems with bullying or are treated unfairly by their classmates a lot of times. Teachers do not always know if the students got bullied. I believe having them know how to treat others the way they would like to be treated is extremely important. This norm takes time to realize, practice and apply it daily. But after they deeply understand it, this will benefit them in the future.

 Be responsible:





               Students will be more successful with their learning by being responsible and participating. 
               For example, students need to attend classes on time and regularly; be prepared for classes 
               with all necessary supplies;and take good care of school property;completing all homework 
               assignments;organizing their time well; doing their best.

Having a positive attitude.

Cultivating students brings a positive attitude in the classroom.Such as understanding peers’ values and culture;maintaining good physical health, exercising, eating right, and getting enough sleep; listening carefully to teachers and parents;developing positive attitudes; being cooperative and considerate;welcoming challenges;helping others.



Strategies or Modifications for the Virtual Learning Environment
In a Virtual classroom, Teachers can provide the space for students to communicate in different ways.  Students have many ways they already use to communicate; ask them what they like and see if it may be appropriate to bring into the classroom setting. Always remind them to respect each other and the public space.

Students can find ways to target others with bias, bullying or other harmful online behavior. Through unsupervised messaging, students can use the chat function to send mean and biased messages to their peers. They can create documents and slide shows and fill them with inappropriate and offensive words and images. The teacher should disable functions that lend themselves to this type of behavior and check in with students regularly to assess whether this is happening. 

Create clear and accessible pathways for students. Provide academic materials in as many formats as possible. Understand there will be wide-ranging homework environments, including varied access to electronic equipment and quiet work areas.Record virtual lessons or meetings, provide both digital and printable copies to broaden your reach. Thus, the students can be prepared and be responsible with their class and homework.

Embrace new tools for new learning.  It can be difficult to learn many new tools and work assignments  virtually. But  guide them to having a positive attitude for online academic studies.





3.Routines and Procedures: Clear and consistent routines and procedures assist teachers in managing their learning environment effectively. List out your top 3-5 routines and procedures that you would implement in your own classroom. Following a routine lets students know what to expect each day in class. While moving away from the routine periodically can be effective for special days, doing it often causes students to be unprepared. (Add more rows as needed to the table.)  Include modifications that you would make for situations when students don’t adhere to a particular routine or procedure. 


Clear Routines and Procedures
Situation 
Steps (and Modifications, if any)
The start routine:
Teacher greeting the students at the door. 
They go through their start of class routine
They sit in their assigned seats. 
They look at the agenda. 
They begin to do the bell work independently.
When they finish, they work on something else or wait quietly. 
Modifications:
Teacher can take attendance while students doing homework
Walk around to check their work
If some students do not follow, talk to them privately and know the reason why.
Find some other bellwork that fit them to do 

      
 Homework-submission routine


Work should be handed in as soon as   students come into the classroom.
Students should always deliver work to a designated location.
Unfinished work should be presented to the teacher directly.
Modifications:
If students do not follow, deduct some points for that, tell them if they can follow the rules for 1 month, they can get the points back.
If they forget for the first time and there is a reason, the teacher should understand.




Restroom routine:





Only allow one student at a time or one boy and one girl
 Feel free to ask before the bell to use the restroom and return shortly after the bell.
In an emergency, you may fill out your planner and raise it above your head. If “emergencies” become frequent, this will be a problem.
Modifications:
If student always ask to go to restroom: 

Be alert for special physical concerns that require a high frequency of restroom visits. 
Be aware of students who may take advantage of the policy.
If it happens many times, I will have a talk with them.
If it still doesn't work, I will ask  them to go to the counselor office.



Absent routine:
Bring the teacher your attendance slip.
Check the Absence File Sorter for the assignments you missed.
Complete the work according to the guidelines stated in your student handbook.
Modifications:
The teacher needs to clearly know the students' absent frequency, if they are always absent, the teacher can let the parents know.
The teacher should offer help if the student is absent  for multiple times,make sure the students can follow.
Routines for the Online Classroom:
The start routine:
Teacher greeting with the students while they join the meeting.
The students make sure their microphone is muted.
Post the bell work on the chat box or on the screen.
When they finish, they work on something else or wait quietly. 
Modifications:
The teacher can ask one student to share their story for one minute, by doing this to create a positive class environment instead of doing bellwork everytime.
The teacher should greet students when they join the meeting.



 Homework-submission routine:


Go to Google classroom to finish the work.
Student work is often time stamped upon submission on digital platforms so that a teacher knows if work was submitted on time.
Late homework needed to be submitted.
Any questions about the homework write on discussion forum, the 
the teacher will reply.
Modifications:

Offer examples of the homework, make sure students know exactly how they need to do it.
Give them extra time to finish but with a deadline.
Offer a small conference time, students can schedule if they need help.
Homework can be different, for the special kids, teachers should make different c





Restroom routine:
 

Use a behavior management system with a restroom option， students can click it, the teacher will see as well.
After getting the teacher’s permission, the  students can leave.

Modifications:
Let students know that if they have a personal emergency and need to go to the bathroom very quickly, they can unmute the microphone and let me know and then immediately leave.
Absent routine:
Write messages to the teacher.
When a student is absent, it is their responsibility to make up for the missed work.
If they need to leave during the class, click the “raise hand ”button to ask permission.

Modifications:

Watch recorded lessons for absent students, in  case students get disconnected.
Observe students if they come back, make sure they did not miss anything and know what to do.
If students do not follow rules, ask them why, if I can not give a solution, ask help from school or counselor. 


Transitions: Plan your transitions with a step-by-step process in the table below, and model with students within the first weeks of school. Review and practice these transitions with students after extended breaks, midyear, and anytime you add a new student to your class. Include specific instructions you would use with students with special needs and English language learners.

Transitions
Situation 
Steps
Entering the class:



Lining up outside of the classroom.
Greeting with the students at the door.
Whiteboard or projector to only show our morning work assignment.
Observe students.
   
 Accommodations:

If the students talk in the hallway, secure students' attention by hand signal.
Play soft music, create a quiet and positive environment for students to calm down.
When it becomes routine, the teacher can have students lead the class to form a line and greet them.
Observe students if there are any problems,especially for special students who need any help.
Switching from one activity to another:
Follow visual picture symbols  provided by the teacher.
Make sure the student understands what the directions are or what is expected of him/her.  
Choosing partners for small group 
activities. 

• Returning equipment or material after the activity if they have.


 Accommodations:

Provide support or different types of support to children during transitions (e.g., photos to help anticipate what activity is next, an individual warning to a student that soon it will be time to clean up and begin a new activity).
Play songs or chants for 30 seconds to signal transitions.  Use the same songs each time so students can anticipate what is to happen next.



Exiting the classroom:
• Putting materials away and preparing
   for the next task. 
• Cleaning up a work area. 
• Moving from group to independent work. 
• Turning in homework if they have.
• Walk out the class quietly.
 
 Accommodations:

Give special students more time if they need.
Teacher needs to check if there are anything students left and collect them.


Transitions for the Online Classroom:
Entering the class:



The teacher greeting  the students online.
Make sure the microphone is muted.




Slides to show the Do-Now work.
Students can type the number “1” to the chat box and that means they have finished.


 Accommodations:

The teacher after a simple greeting with the students, each class can choose one student to share small things that happened during the day. This can secure students' attention and help students ease and relax.
Always make sure to find an easy way to get students' feedback.Eg. Type “1” in the chat box.
Observe the students if they are always slow at doing the work.Give extra support for them. E.g.if their device does not work well.The teacher can give the student more time or have them to make up.


Switching from one activity to another:
Follow visual picture symbols  provided by the teacher.
Make sure the student understands what the directions are or what is expected of him/her.  
Having instructions as an easy way to access for students.
The teacher can use zoom to group students.
The teacher goes to each group to observe and make sure students  are there.
Remind the time for each group.





 Accommodations:

 If the students don’t know how 
to use the function of the online 
tools, the teacher should have a 
reminder or example before they start as a group.
 If it is an individual activity, make sure instructions are always shown on screen.
Accept different types of work as an assessment.
Exiting the classroom:
Wrap up the lesson.
Making sure students have no questions for this class.
Having an exit ticket for students.


 Accommodations:

Create an opportunity to reflect for students.
Discuss questions such as: What did you learn? What surprised you? What is unclear? What do you want to know more about? Then ask them to come up with a closing statement or question about the content and write it down. 
Rate the Learning or Lesson: This exit ticket can be accomplished in a matter of minutes. Ask students to rate—on a scale of 1 to 10—how well they understood the learning that day.




Responding to Traumatic Stress: Create a data gathering exercise to understand students’ backgrounds and identify if any of them have experienced traumatic stress. Tip: Previous teachers are sometimes a good source of information. Complete the chart below with possible strategies that you would use for specific types of trauma.

Response to Traumatic Stress
Trauma Symptoms
Response Strategies
Physical Abuse


Unexplained injuries (or injuries that don't match the explanation given)
Changes in behavior and/or academic performance
Sudden loss of self-confidence
Often absent from school from school
Change in behavior (becoming more rebellious)
Self-harm and/or hurts other students
Build a connection with the student firstly. While you may not be able to change what goes on at home, you can certainly change what happens in the classroom. Let your students know you care for them and that you are always there to help them. If a student trusts you, they might open up about their home life.

Explain to the students that the abuse is not their fault. They hold zero responsibility for what has happened. As soon as possible, a teacher should report the abuse to the relevant authorities (follow the school procedures) and take note. Follow up with the report in a timely fashion to ensure your report has been passed on to authorities.

It is important not to 'over promise' the student here. While you will try to help, you mightn't be able to fix the problem. Don't offer more than you can legally do. Don't confront the offender. Instead make sure the student knows more than anything else that you believe them and you will support them as much as legally able.

Refugee Trauma



 

Isolating 
Not spending time with others
Not enjoying or participating in activities.
Frequent outbursts
Attend engagement and cultural considerations as important first steps.
Work to build trust with the student, not only to increase the benefits of treatment, but also to ensure the student will accept your recommendations and referrals.
Listen to the student's concerns, acknowledge the importance of their expressed primary problems, and address first the basic or most urgent needs.
Focus on aspects of the mental health services that relate to the family’s expressed values, such as supporting a child’s academic success.


 Bullying

Bullying includ：
Physical (hitting, tripping, kicking, etc.)
Verbal (name calling, teasing, taunting, threatening, and sexual comments)
Social (spreading rumors, embarrassing someone in public, being purposefully exclusive). 
Cyberbullying includes sending negative, harmful, and/or false content electronically via text messages or email, as well as posting mean text or hurtful pictures online through social media, blogs, etc.
 
Bullying  symptoms
Anger or frustration
Loneliness and isolation
Feelings of rejection, or poor self-esteem
Changes in sleep and eating patterns
Health complaints
Poor relational skills


Ensuring the student is safe and seek ways to prevent future bullying experiences
Talking through what happened and why, to help clear up misconceptions about their role in the traumatic event
Teaching stress management and relaxation techniques, to help them cope
Promoting physical and emotional safety in relationships and the environment
Reducing trauma-related triggers in the school environment
Considering trauma in all assessment and protocol behavior plans
Ensuring students and families have voice, choice, and empowerment	
Complex Trauma


Change in personal self-concept
Distrust
Suicidal thoughts
Episodes of feeling detached from one’s body or mental processes
Isolation, guilt, shame, or a feeling of being totally different from other people
Helplessness and feeling hopeless
Becoming preoccupied with revenge or, conversely, giving total power to the perpetrator
Self-harm, self-mutilation
Alcoholism, substance abuse


The current method for treating complex trauma is a combination of talk therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and exposure therapy.
Effective treatment needs to focus on self-regulatory deficits rather than processing the trauma
Therapeutic groups can also benefit complex trauma survivors. Such groups can foster safety and self-understanding. They can also help reduce isolation, shame and related cognitive distortions (i.e. things we believe which aren’t accurate). 
Peer (from other survivors) support can also be very important. Peers can apply an understanding of their own experiences to promote safety, build on strengths, empower recovery and build hope, optimism and support for healing. Trauma-informed peer support fosters a shared understanding of trauma experiences, coping strategies, recovery and mutual support. 








Technology Tools: Technology can improve the way you manage the learning environment by helping save instructional time, track trends in student behavior, create lines of communication 
with families, and even empower students to take leadership roles. Integrate some technology tools for managing the learning environment in a physical and online classroom into this planning document and explain how you plan to use each. 

Management Technology
Technology
Rationale and Use
Class 123


Rationale:

-Class123 is both a classroom management system as well as a place where valuable teaching tools are gathered together. 

-Class123 is available in both PCs and mobile devices. It helps teachers to regulate everything happening in class. The mobile application of Class123 comes with 3 different versions, for teacher, parent and student. This provides great versatility and improves user-experience,

- Class123 promotes communication and collaboration between students, teachers, and parents. Class123 enables teachers to control and keep track of students’ behavior and also improve students’ participation and excitement through the multiple tools provided. 

Use:
-The teacher can grant points to the students to reward their positive behavior in the form of cards. In case of misbehavior, points can be retracted. 
-There is always the option to edit the reward cards according to your own needs.
- One special thing that sets Class123 apart, is the ability to set whole-class goals in the form of “golden eggs”. Students earn “golden eggs” when a certain number of “wow” cards are awarded, therefore, leading the whole class to reach a common goal.
-The tool on class 123   is called lucky draw. Lucky draw randomly selects a single student from the classroom’s list. For example, one may use it to randomly select someone to answer a question.
-The wheel picker is a wheel-of-fortune-like tool. Pieces can be assigned to students to randomly pick one and then continue with the rest. 
-The random matchup is used to create random pairings between students or even between students and objects of your choice. It can be used in a variety of creative activities, and the possibilities are endless.
-Various activities tools such as the timer, the stopwatch and the alarm are provided.
Deck-Toys
Rationale:
 
-Deck.Toys allows teachers to teach and engage students by taking your usual lesson materials and turn them into guided activities that let your students show you what they know as they work at their own pace.
 
--It helps students to collaborate or challenge another classmate in real-time.

-Teachers may  turn the classroom into the student-paced mode by switching to Free Mode. In Free Mode, students can explore and choose their own paths and activities to complete. Students may gain mastery on the Study Sets by repetitive review and self-practice. 


Use:

-It’s really easy to create lessons with Deck.Toys using its drag-and-drop capability. It can build complete lessons within minutes with your existing teaching content such as study sets, PowerPoints or Google Slides, images, videos, links, sites, or PDFs.

- Begin by building a map full of Activities for your students to complete and conquer. Your map will usually consist of Signposts (instructions for students), Slides (content you want them to learn), and Study Sets Activities. Each of these Activities has their unique functionality in ensuring an interactive lesson is created. There are 18 different Study Sets activities.

-In the Teacher Sync mode,  every device will be synced to the teacher’s screen. This is great at the beginning of the lesson where teachers are introducing fundamental lesson concepts and to get students aligned with your content. Annotations made on the slide will also be synced.

-Slides App: Presentation materials like images, videos, links, sites, or PDFs that you can create question/answer activities using text, draw , placemaker or a quick poll. 

Signpost : Signposts allow you to add notes, directions, or just some plain old anticipation for what is to come.




Rationale:

-Blooket is a trivia and review tool that allows teachers to “level up classroom engagement” , it  is a gamified learning platform where teachers host games through question sets and students answer on their own devices. 
 
-This is also an assessment-centered tool, specifically formative assessment.
 
- The new take on reviewing or practicing material can increase student engagement and excitement.

Use:

-The most prominent feedback for students is positive reinforcement.When students get correct answers, they receive points, which allow them to buy and sell ‘Blooks’. 
-On Blooket there are hundreds of premade question sets for you to use or you have the option to make your own set unique to your class.
 
 -Students can utilize this tool to collaborate with fellow classmates and peers by working in pairs or on teams.
 
-Students only need a join code to join the game so students from around the world are able to connect and play in real time.
Technology for the Online Classroom:
Gimkit
Rationale:

-Gimkit is an interactive digital quiz-style game that can excite and inspire learning.
- Gimkit allows educators and students to create multiple choice questions from scratch for any topic area and it also allows users to import Quizlet sets to easily create a “Kit.” 
-Teachers receive a data report at the end of each game that shows the overall class and individual student responses. The data makes this a helpful tool for formative assessment, providing students with quick feedback, and identifying areas that need to be taught/re-taught.
Use:
-One of the motivating features within Gimkit is the ability to earn “money” (by getting answers correct) and using the “money” to buy various power-ups.
-Gimkit allows for entire class collaboration using a tool called a KitCollab (collaborative Gimkit). Students work together to create a “Kit” (quiz). They submit questions and as the educator you have the power to accept or reject the proposed questions.
Vocaroo
Rationale:

-Vocaroo is an online tool that allows users to record, send, and download voice messages. Teachers and learners can use Vocaroo in different activities, such as podcasting, digital storytelling, broadcasting, and giving feedback. Recordings can be downloaded, sent, or even scanned with a QR code reader.

Use:

-Feedback and Comments: Learners and teachers can provide voice comments. They can share a link to the voice comments in a Google Doc, blog, or learning management system, such as Moodle, Blackboard, or Google Classroom.

-English Language Learning: Learners can record and listen to themselves. Students can take notes on their grammar and pronunciation. They can also use Vocaroo to rehearse their presentations. Record their presentations, listen, and practice.
-Class activities: Podcasting, making a character interview or historical event dramatization, online discussions, explaining a process or procedure in Math or Science, the possibilities are endless for classroom activities.
-Combining Vocaroo with other tools: The Vocaroo recorded messages can be embedded in Google Earth, Padlet, or Thinglink.  Look at an example of digital geography .



Communicating With Families: Use the box below to describe tools that you would use to communicate regularly with families about students’ progress, achievements, or behaviors?

Family Communication
Tools for Regular Communication: What tools will you use to ensure that you regularly communicate students’ progress, achievements, and behaviors to families?
 Class 123
It does offer classroom management capabilities to the teacher, but it also embeds a version for parents communicating. 
The mobile application of Class123 comes with 3 different versions, for teacher, parent and student. This provides great versatility and improves user-experience, since everyone gets to see what interests him/her. For example, it’s doubtful that parents would like to have a count-down tool but it’s pretty sure that they would welcome receiving notifications about their children. That’s why the existence of three different versions is pretty smart.

Make parents part of the classroom community.
Invite parents into the classroom for special activities so they can take part in your community. You might invite them to whole-class debates, classroom performances, presentations, or art gallery walks.This also helps to communicate with the parents.
Phone home.
Try setting aside 15 to 20 minutes each week or every other week to call parents for a friendly update.It helps teachers and parents to build bridges between school and home and foster trust, they also give teachers a chance to talk through concerns and brainstorm solutions.
Reporting Requirements for Suspected Child Abuse:


You have “Reasonable Cause to Suspect” that abuse has occurred. 	
 Someone lets you know about an identifiable child having been abused, even if this is told to you when you are not at your workplace.
you should report whenever you have the nagging feeling that abuse/neglect may have happened.
 
When making a report of suspected child abuse or general child well-being concerns, it is important to provide information of the following.
 
Age or approximate age range of the child
Name and physical description of the child
Name, home address, and telephone number of legal guardian or parent of the child
Name or physical description of suspected child abuse perpetrator
Home address and telephone number of suspected child abuse perpetrator
Any concern for the child's immediate safety
Your relationship to the child
