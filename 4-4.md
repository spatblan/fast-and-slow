## CERT Module 4: Managing the Learning Environment 

## Managing Student Behavior

### Overview

Even when teachers set clear classroom expectations, build routines and procedures, it is always important to remember to expect the unexpected. In managing the learning environment, teachers must be prepared with a variety of strategies and interventions for behavior management in response to disruptions in the classrooms. Professional learning communities (PLC) exist to provide both behavioral and academic interventions to students who are not thriving. Students are identified and placed into intervention groups by their teachers. Whole brain teaching is another approach to managing student behavior in which you look at engaging students’ whole brain and not leaving any room for disruptions. Social-emotional learning (SEL) is the process through which all young people acquire and apply the knowledge, skills, and attitudes to develop healthy identities, manage emotions and achieve personal and collective goals.

 ## Responding to Traumatic Stress

 ## Overview

Some students have experienced traumatic stress in their lives and it changes their worldview and impacts their behavior at school. For example, students may have witnessed school shootings, natural disasters like  floods, fires or earthquakes, death of a parent or sibling, or personal trauma such as bullying, cyberbullying, a brain injury or Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Teachers need to be aware of their students’ backgrounds so that they can respond to traumatic stress in students appropriately.
