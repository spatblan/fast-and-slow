## Student Data Analysis

### Overview

There are many factors that contribute to student achievement. These factors can include everything from cognitive ability to parental involvement and other environmental factors. As a teacher, it is important to review and analyze which of these factors influence each student’s achievement positively and negatively and use this data to inform your instructional strategies and practices. This information helps you begin to diagnose your students’ academic and developmental needs. It can also help you identify areas for improvement in the classroom or school environment, policies, and processes. In this activity, I will recognize these influences and apply them to your current or future school and student population. This information helps you begin to think of ways that you may have to differentiate your instruction to meet their academic and development needs. It can also help you identify any achievement gaps that exist at the school, state, or national (country) level.
